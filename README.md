    title:Â "Hi, looking for a starter? ðŸ”Ž",
    // choose a message to display below the comment
    message: "ðŸš§ Host me on your domain while you build your new Gatsby site! (or keep me longer, that's fine too) ðŸ‘·",
    // choose a pattern (see https://gatsby-starter-under-construction.netlify.com/patterns)
    pattern: "Seigaiha",
    // choose a color for your text and icons
    color: "#4c4c4c",
    // choose a Google Font for the title
    headingFont: "Lobster",
    // choose a Google Font for the message

Performance is only hindered by Google Fonts being hosted on Google's CDN. If you don't need to change fonts often, consider self-hosting your webfonts.
